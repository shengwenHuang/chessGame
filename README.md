# chessGame
A CLI chess game for two human players.


A chessboard is a 8 * 8 matrix. It has a notation from A-H and 1-8. Here (1-8) are rows and (A-H) are columns. We always refer the position of a chess piece by its chess notation. For example, “E4” means 4th row, 5th column of the 8 * 8 matrix.


The application can check 


1. if a chess move is valid


2. if the piece follows the rules (such as Knight moves in L shape) 


3. if the target position of the move is not of the same colour  


4. if the piece end up outside of the board


The application also provides a ‘-help’ option to display a brief textual guide on how to use the chess game.
